# Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms
Insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

The SortProject.pdf contains the results of this study, while all the resources are provided in the other folders. 

Instructions to run the data yourself:
- Download all folders
- SortCompAsgn.cpp is the file you will run to check the number of assignments and comparisons for each algorithm.
- Make sure the the following directories are included in the project: ../CAMetrics;../Counter;../ASeq;../ASorter;../ArrayT;../Utilities 
- And make sure to add the library file: ../Utilities/dist/Debug/CLang-MacOSX/libutilities.a
- Once you run SortCompAsgn.cpp, enter an array capacity, then enter the name of one of the files which contain the unsorted items (e.g File Name? d06400). These files are contained within the SortCompAsgn folder.
- If you are interested in the statistical analysis of the results provided by running SortCompAsgn.cpp, open the SortProject.Rproj file and input your own values inside of asgnData.txt and compData.txt.

Enjoy!

This could not have been done without the immense help and guidance of Stan Warford of Pepperdine University.
